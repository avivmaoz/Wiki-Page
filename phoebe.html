                 Phoebe was born on February 16 and is the daughter of Frank and Lily Buffay. Her birth mother's name was Phoebe Abbott, for whom she was named after. Phoebe has a twin sister, Ursula, who is also portrayed by Kudrow.<br>
                 Phoebe can speak several languages, including French and Italian. She is a masseuse and musician, notable for her offbeat and extremely ditzy behavior. She was Monica Geller's roommate before Rachel Green, which is how she was introduced to the group. She plays a guitar and sings at Central Perk. <br>
                 During the show's ninth season, Phoebe and Joey decide to choose a blind date for each other. Phoebe finds someone for him, but Joey forgets about their deal and doesn't find anyone for her. So a couple of minutes before the date, Joey accidentally finds Mike who agrees to go on a blind date with Phoebe. Mike Hannigan (played by Paul Rudd) and Phoebe begin a romantic relationship. They later get engaged and then marry.

                <h4><u>Smelly Cat</u></h4>
                The show's running gag and one of Phoebe's trademark characteristics is her song "Smelly Cat", which she performs at Central Perk. The song is about a cat who is shunned by society because of its foul stench as a result of flatulence ("What are they feeding you?"). However Phoebe sympathizes with it because she can relate to being an outcast.

                Friends is an American television sitcom, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring

                <a href = "monica.html"> Courteney Cox</a>, 
                <a href = "phoebe.html">Lisa Kudrow</a>, 
                <a href = "joey.html">Matt LeBlanc</a>, 
                <a href = "chandler.html">Matthew Perry</a> and 
                <a href = "ross.html">David Schwimmer</a>, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City.

                <h4><u>Origin of name</u></h4>
                At first Kauffman and Crane began developing the show under the title 'Insomnia Cafe', between November and December 1993. During several script rewrites the title changed a few times. The titles 'Six of One' and 'Friends Like Us' were among the first ideas, until finally the series was named Friends.

                <h4><u>Main Idea</u></h4>
                Rachel Green, a sheltered but friendly woman, flees her wedding day and wealthy yet unfulfilling life and finds childhood friend Monica Geller, a tightly wound but caring chef. Rachel moves into Monica's apartment above Central Perk and joins Monica's group of single friends in their mid-20s: previous roommate Phoebe Buffay, an eccentric, weird masseuse; neighbor Joey Tribbiani, a dim-witted yet loyal struggling actor and womanizer; Joey's roommate Chandler Bing, a sarcastic, self-deprecating IT manager; and Monica's older brother and Chandler's college roommate Ross Geller, a sweet-natured but insecure paleontologist.<br>

                Episodes depict the friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues. The six characters each have many dates and serious relationships.

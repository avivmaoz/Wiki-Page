                He is an Italian-American struggling actor who lives in New York City with his roommate and best friend, Chandler Bing. After Chandler moved out, he lived with a few other roommates.<br>

                Joey  is from Queens, New York and is Catholic. Joey comes from a working-class Italian-American family of eight children, of which he is the only boy. As a child, he was extremely accident-prone.<br>

                Joey is portrayed as promiscuous and dim-witted but good-natured, as well as very loyal, caring, and protective of his friends. He is a food-loving womanizer who has had more luck with dates than any of the other group members. In contrast to his persona as the "ladies’ man", he has also a marked childish side.<br>
                As a struggling actor, he is constantly looking for work. He was ordained as a minister and officiated at both Monica and Chandler's and Phoebe and Mike's weddings.<br>

                He does not like sharing food,especially when it is pizza and has difficulty with simple mathematics.<br>

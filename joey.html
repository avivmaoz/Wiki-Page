                He is an Italian-American struggling actor who lives in New York City with his roommate and best friend, Chandler Bing, and hangs out in a tight-knit group of his best friends: Chandler, Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), and Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow). He lived with a few other roommates when Chandler moved out to move in with Monica.

Joey was presumably born in 1968 as he talks about being 13 in 1981.[2] He is from Queens, New York and is Catholic.[3] Joey comes from a working-class Italian-American family of eight children, of which he is the only boy. His father Joseph Tribbiani, Sr. (Robert Costanzo), is a pipefitter, and his mother's name is Gloria (Brenda Vaccaro). Joey has seven sisters: Mary Therese (Mimi Lieber on Friends) a.k.a. Mary Teresa (Christina Ricci on Joey), Mary Angela (Holly Gagnier), Dina (Marla Sokoloff), Gina (K.J. Steinberg on Friends, Drea de Matteo on Joey), Tina (Lisa Maris),[4] Veronica (Dena Miceli),[4] and Cookie (Alex Meneses). As a child, he was extremely accident-prone.[5] In "The One with Ross' New Girlfriend", it was implied that he was sexually abused by his tailor but didn't realize it until Chandler went to the same tailor.

Joey is portrayed as promiscuous and dim-witted but good-natured, as well as very loyal, caring, and protective of his friends. He is a food-loving womanizer who has had more luck with dates than any of the other group members. In contrast to his persona as the "ladies’ man", he has also a marked childish side.

                According to Elle, the combined popularity of Monica and Cox established them both as television icons during the 1990s. Additionally, baby name books commonly associate the name "Monica" with the character. <br>
                As the role in which Cox "found fame", Monica remains the actress' most iconic performance to-date,as well as the role for which she is best known.

                Ross is a paleontologist and has a Ph.D. from Columbia University.<br>
                 His romantic feelings toward Rachel Green, which began as a high-school infatuation, are an ongoing theme of his narrative arc. Likewise, their on-again, off-again romantic relationship is a nearly constant theme of Friends.<br>

                Born on October 18, 1967 and raised on Long Island, Ross is the elder brother of Monica Geller. Ross and Monica are Jewish and see themselves as at least cultural Jews, with Ross taking a more active role in wanting to teach his son, Ben, about the faith. <br>
                Ross gets divorced and is newly single in the very first episode because his wife, Carol, has realized she's a lesbian.<br>
                 Later in the series, he dates Rachel, but they split up when he sleeps with another woman the night they decide their relationship is "on a break". After his relationship with Rachel ends, Ross marries Emily Waltham. However, because Ross says "I take thee Rachel" instead of Emily during the nuptials, the marriage doesn't last long.<br>
                  In season 5, Ross and Rachel drunkenly marry in Las Vegas, and ultimately that marriage results in a divorce as well. Throughout the series, Ross gets divorced three times.<br>
                  Later on, Ross and Rachel end up having a baby girl, Emma.

                 Chandler was born to Nora Tyler Bing, an erotic romance novelist, and Charles Bing, a gay female impersonator and star of a Las Vegas drag show called "Viva Las Gay-gas" as Helena Handbasket. He is of Scottish and Swedish descent. He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family. Chandler's parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old, an event which causes him to refuse to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood and develop his notorious sense of humour as a defense mechanism.<br>
                 Chandler's best friend is Joey Tribbiani, who is his roommate. He previously lived with his good friend Ross Geller.<br>
                  He is the highest earning member of his friends' circle on account of responsible income management, having learned the value of money from a young age.<br> He suffers from commitment issues, but later marries Monica at the end of season 7. In season 10, he and Monica go on to adopt twins.<br>
                  Chandler works in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration, which he takes up as temporary work. Despite disliking his job, Chandler stays because they keep giving him promotions and raises, eventually becoming boss to his old workmates.<br>
                  Chandler is first seen smoking during the first season and is chastised by his friends for breaking his non-smoking streak of three years. He does a fairly good job at controlling his habit throughout the series' run, although a few times he cannot resist temptation and has a single cigarette or just a single drag off someone else's. <br>

                Monica is the younger sister of Ross Geller and best friend of Rachel Green. She is a chef known for her cleanliness, competitiveness and obsessive-compulsive nature.<br>
                Rachel and Monica spend several years living together as roommates until Monica begins a romantic relationship with long-time neighbor and friend Chandler Bing, whom she marries.<br>
                 Unable to conceive children on their own, Chandler and Monica eventually adopt twins Erica and Jack and move out of their apartment into a larger house in the suburbs.<br>

                The creators' first choice for the role of Monica was comedian Janeane Garofalo. Cox had originally been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing the character's best friend Monica because she was drawn to her strong personality. <br>
